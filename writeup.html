   I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The size of training set is 34799
   </li>
   <li>
    The size of the validation set is 4410
   </li>
   <li>
    The size of test set is 12630
   </li>
   <li>
    The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
   </li>
   <li>
    The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

   Here’s a bar chart showing the distribution of different class of traffic signs from the training data. The x-axis shows the traffic sign type index, and the y-axis shows the count of training images for that class.
  </p>
  <p>
   We can see that it’s not distributed evenly. Some traffic signs appear much more often than others in this training data set.

   1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the “Stand Out Suggestions” part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)
  </h4>
  <p>
   I did two steps for preprocessing the images.
  </p>
  <p>
   First I turn image into grayscale. Color is not that useful (compared with shape or contrast) when identifying traffic sign. Converting from RGB color to grayscale greatly reduces the data size and makes our training more efficient.
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt="alt text" src="./images/2.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="alt text" src="./images/3.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Then I normalize the picture. We learned that putting all input data within the range of (-1,1) with a mean of 0 will makes our training more efficient.

   My final model consisted of the following layers:

Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.
  </h4>
  <p>
   My final model results were:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     training set accuracy of 1.000
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     validation set accuracy of 0.926
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     test set accuracy of 0.928
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   If an iterative approach was chosen:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   In the begining, my choice of architecture was very similar to the final one, except that the output channels and fully connected nodes are much much smaller, like 5~10x smaller.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    What were some problems with the initial architecture?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   I found that my training and validation accuracy couldn’t raise more than 85%. I tried with different number of batch size, number of epochs, and learning rate, none of that really helped.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   I thought my model might not be complicated enough, thus it might be under fitting. So I increase the size of the convolution output, so is the fully connected layer size. But it was not very easy to find a good number. When I set the network size to be too big, the validation accuracy actually decreases. After several trial, I tried to lower the learning rate from 0.001 to 0.0005, and it does increase the validation accuracy and the accuracy over later epochs are much more stable.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Batch size and number of epochs. The latter was easier to tune because a higher number of epochs combined with moderate learning rate will certainlly always makes the result better. Batch size is a bit weird and I don’t fully understand how it affected the result. I tried to make it bigger or smaller and finally set it to 128.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Convolution is certainly helpful because the traffic sign is a typical example of pixel patterns being features. Convolution combines low-level features (pixels) into higher-level features (patterns) and these higher-level features are bascially able to match the traffic sign’s design.
  </p>
  <p>
   I didn’t use dropout layer. I tried to add it but unfortunately I didn’t find it generates much difference for my case.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a well known architecture was chosen:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    What architecture was chosen?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   I chose the well-known LeNet architecture.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   LeNet was designed to recognize written numbers. I think traffic sign has a lot of similarities when compared with written numbers because both features= line patterns (curve, straight line, dots) and none of then features colors or lighting conditions.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    How does the final model’s accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The training accuracy is 100%, and the validation and test accuracy are around 93%. I think the result looks good. It might be a little overfitted, but overall still generalizes well.
